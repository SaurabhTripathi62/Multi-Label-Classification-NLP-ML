2,"The rebate is a good thing for having a  ABC YYY Card.  However, the rule is really rigid.  
My recent call was to ask for waiving the interest charge for late payment.  I have given the following reasons:
1) I always pay on time and it was my first late payment.
2) The payment was on Oct 16 and the due date was on Oct 15, just one day late.
3) October 15, is my birthday and a lot of celebrations happened on the day, so I missed to pay on time.
The customer service said he could not do anything to waive the payment.  I asked for talking to his supervisor or manager.  He replied they are not available.  
I have another credit card with the same due date and I also pay one day after the due day.  They did not charge me any interest or late payment penalty.","Brand ,Customer Service ,Payments ,Policy ,Promotions and Benefits ,Terms ,Terms "

4,"Generally not a long time waiting for an agent.  Spoke to gentlemen regarding my issue and he was very helpful.  He gave me another number to call to discuss my issue and I will get results.
I went on line to find a hotel room in St. Jacobs Ontario, pricing was good so I reserved a room for two adults.  I received an email from company advising me of my confirmation of date, location and cost.  I was also advised that I could call within 24 hours of date booked to cancel.  I the received an email from MC YYY to alert us of a pending charge of $177.66 an international charge.  I immediately went to my on line account and discovered that that there was a charge pending of $177.66 Canadian.  I called the company and I advised I wanted to cancel because I did not know that the charges would be iin US funds as I had reserved a room in Canada and was paying for the room with a Canadian Credit card number.  I wrote this complaint to the company.  Later that night I received a second email that the reservation is being cancelled and I am not sure if they are going to reverse the charges.  If the pending charges have been moved to my MC YYY account I am to call you folks to make sure this was done.  I was also not advised by the agent that it was a non-refunadable charge.  What kind of company operates with this kind of service.  I appreciate any assistance from you folks.

5,"I received an e-mail from  ABC starting that I had been charged twice for a transaction but no details on when, why or by whom.  Obviously I was very anxious so called  Customer Service, the representative asked me my name, birthdate and card number, 3 digit code on my card etc etc to establish my identity and I had no problem with that, but she would not let me explain the reason for my call until she had asked me question after question about my employer, length of employment, address even though on file, cell number and insisted on sending me a text which I had to wait and reply too along with other multiple questions to update all my file even though I told her how do you think I receive payment postings and e-,mails to my phone unless you have already all this information.  She kept telling me we will get to your issue when  all this is updated.  Then after I obediantly as a child agreed to her many many questions let me explain my issue only to be told that she could not help me but would forward me to another agent, after a while waiting he answered me only to again start to ask me 101 same questions that I had just been asked.  He then put me on hold for so long that I hung up never resolving g .y issue, I was very frustrated and disappointed with  ABC Customer Service.  Therefore don't think I would rush out and recommend them to friends ds and family.  I understand the need for security but this was just over the top at a time when I had called for answers.","Customer Service ,Fraud and Disputes ,Issue Resolution ,Phone Experience ,Phone Experience ,Representative ,Representative ,Representative ,Representative "

 That is why I will not recommend this card. If a cardholder advises the administration to turn off tap on the card you should comply. I am responsible for what happens to my cart, it is my credit rating and I take that very seriously.

78,"I made 2 calls to CO during the same day.  The first call did not resolve my issue.  I had rented a car for a very important family weekend that we do once a year.  That morning, the rental company sent an email stating that a deposit of $250.00 was required.  Had I of known this, I would have made a bigger payment.  When I arrived to pick up the car, I was $20.00 short of 250.00 for the deposit on my card and he rental company would not allow me to pay the difference in cash.  Our weekend was ruined.  I called CO back again to ask if there was anything that could be done to allow the hold of funds to go through.  It wasn’t even a charge that would be permanent.  The agent said no again.  I asked to speak to a supervisor. This is where your service shone.  I spoke to an amazing young man in New Brunswick who quickly figured out a way to allow the payment sitting on the account to release the funds.  He stayed on the line with me as I ran back to the rental company and had the $250.00 deposit put through.  He was kind, thoughtful, professional and efficient.  He saved the weekend for my two children and I who are 10 and 8 and we’re in tears that our weekend may have been ruined over $20.00.  Had it not been for this employee, I would have a very bad impression of your service but he went above and beyond for your customer and he should be commended.

The hold was due to potential fraudulent charges that I had no problem clearing up. However, when I asked the phone attendant why I wasn't contacted by email, text or phone about the hold on my card, she wasn't very helpful. She kept insisting that there was a way to request such a notification in the online ""Alert"" section but there was not. I explained to her what was seeing on my computer screen and she was not able to provide any help finding such a setting. A simple solution was for her to acknowledge that there is no alert setting to notify clients when a card is on hold for fraud (or any other reason) and provide assurance that a suggestion will be logged.

I don't forget things like that & as such, I'm now a loyal patron... & I think that covers it.","Account Communications ,Brand ,Brand ,Credit/Debit Card ,Credit/Debit Card ,Data and ID Security ,Fraud and Disputes ,Fraud and Disputes ,Life Events ,Payments ,Policy "

344,"I was given a charge of $29 for going over my credit limit. They explained to me that it was noted in the fine print of my welcome package. I believe that a credit limit is just that - a limit! If I am charging a transaction that will put me over my limit, then it should be declined. The associate on the phone said that it was probably only a few dollars over and rather than decline the transaction, they let it through. I'm sorry but I would rather have a transaction declined rather than pay an extra $29 fee. The associate on the phone did absolutely nothing to reduce or remove this charge. We are very reliable clients who pay their balance in full every month. I was left feeling very frustrated and disappointed.

345,"On Oct. 22, 2018 my card was restricted for use without any notice. We happened to be out of province for 5 days.  I was told my address wasn't correct, when I had received my statement 7 days before this.  The customer service reps (as I called twice) continued to tell me that I didn't have a proper mailing address as it was a Box number.  We have had the same mailing address from Canada Post for the past 35 yrs. and they have not contacted us to tell us otherwise.  As confirmed by the fact your Statements have been mailed and received by us every month.  
It was very frustrating to have our card restricted over this issue.  NO attempt was made to phone, text, email or mail us to follow up with your concern. You have successfully emailed me other documentation so why couldn't something have been sent to me?  My payments have always been made on time.  I doubt we are the only people in Canada using a box number that have  ABC cards. 
I don't believe this incident is completely solved because the representative was only satisfied when I gave him my legal address along with my postal code as a mailing address - which is NOT an official Canada Post address but I needed my card activated and he thought it was an address and seemed satisfied.

Even when I was back on track and could have had any other card I still used my ABC card. Back in 2016 maybe early 2017 I was looking to make sure the card I had met my needs for rewards. I found another ABC card that I felt would be better. So after 14 years with ABC and NO credit issues and a beacon score over 800 I applied to simply change my card to something that gave me rewards that suited my needs. A week later I received a letter being rejected for the card. No reason why just you could not extend to me at that time. In that moment I made the decision to stop using the ABC and recently have closed the account. No one asked my why I wanted to close the account and when I called back when I was rejected no one could give me any answers. So I would probably recommend ABC to people because I still respect what they did for me back 15+ plus years ago.

As a result 3 days after my due date I got a warning that the payment had not been received.  I immediately paid the outstanding balance in full as I have always done.  Shortly after my account with you showed a 45 dollar interest charge.  I phoned and the customer service rep as a good will gesture credited me 30 dollars.  3 days.  Look at my account I have never and I mean never not paid my outstanding balance in full each billing period.  No grace, no anything.  I have a hard time dealing with a credit card company that has zero tolerance for a 3 day late payment.  This is the second time we have had an issue in the past 3 months, the last one was when you denied a purchase that I had approved without any justification except to say safety, because I did not see an email that you sent.  Really quick off the draw.  I have other cards and will probably start using them.  The only reason I stay with you is the cash back, but that seems fairly lacklustre if I am going to start having ongoing issues with your policies.","Becoming a Customer ,Brand ,Issue Resolution ,Life Events ,Payments ,Payments ,Policy ,Representative ,Rewards ,Rewards ,Terms "

it's the first time in my CC user's life that i have seen a fraudulent transaction not reverted until at least 1 or 2 months have passed ... it's plain ridiculous and for sure i will never recomment this card or  ABC to anybody ....","Account Communications ,Brand ,Credit/Debit Card ,Credit/Debit Card ,Customer Service ,Fraud and Disputes ,Fraud and Disputes ,Phone Experience ,Phone Experience ,Representative ,Representative "

I am now in need of a Credit Card to use while travelling next month and went first to ABC because it's who I was with before but the limit that was set was $300.  I can't really use it for much so it's upsetting that I have to change carriers and go to a different card.  I did end up getting another card but would love to stay with you all, but I can't travel with $300 as you know ;)

It was really annoying that first you enter info about yourself in automated system, then to a live person who asks so many security questions, who finally transfers you to security department personnel whom you tell your story from scratch, and then it takes another few minutes to go through all security question, and after 30 minutes of going through all this hectic process, you were told that nothing can be done. First, I was told that my wife can't buy air tickets online because she was a secondary card holder, and there is no way to resolve this, but after my repeated requests, she was allowed to buy tickets for one leg of the travel. there is definitely inconsistency in statements made. Then, I wasn't able to buy other leg of the travel because  ABC YYY Master card has not joined the program (Master Card Secure Code) implemented by Flydubai. Finally, I gave up, and bought tickets through Triangle master Card. But, still, I couldn't understand why my wife was able to buy departure tickets and I was not able to buy arrival tickets, and secondly, why  ABC doesn't join Master Card Secure Code Program. It is more secure, and gives customer opportunity to buy stuff from more merchants. 

Moreover, one of the customer service reps, was rude, and treated me like kids, and was teaching me that being a primary card holder, I will be responsible for the expenses occurred due to secondary card holder (the thing which a novice even knows). This happened first time in last 14 years, that I came to know (As her that rep) that my wife as a secondary card holder can't buy $674 worth online tickets. I had been a secondary cardholder for her on TD Visa for years now, and made online purchase including air tickets on countless occasions without any problem.

I made a down-payment of $3,500 and the balance of $5,000 will be paid on completion of the installation around the middle of November.  Since I also use my  ABC MasterCard for YYY purchases I requested this increase to facilitate the process as I did not want the second transaction of $5,000 to be stopped or my YYY weekly purchases to be turned aside.
As you are fully aware, I pay the balance of my account when my statement is received.
As I mentioned to your people, one does not upgrade flooring frequently and the increased limit was only to facilitate the transaction.
As discussed, I will transfer sufficient funds into my credit card account so that when the transaction from Alexanian is processed there will be a ""credit"" balance to allow the transaction to go through.

1097,"My current limit is $6000. I have asked on more than one occasion for it to be raised because my wife and I want to book a cruise and use the credit card for that. It is not unusual for a cruise to cost $4000 for each person, so bearing in mind the ""normal"" usage of maybe 2-3 thousand $ per month, that only leaves 3-4 thousand $ spare space, which precludes us using the YYY card for complete payment for the cruise. I have always paid the credit card bills on time, and do not understand why I am being able to have the credit limit raised. Staff I have spoken to have not been able to give me a logical reason except that I am not charging enough on the card. My wife and I have other credit cards and they seem quite happy to put our credit limit at $12000. In fact, last week we received a letter from one of the other cards we hold that we had been approved for a credit limit increase, should we so desire, and this is for a card that we use much less than the YYY card. In summary, It doesn't make business sense to me for the unwillingness to raise our limit as, in the case of the cruise, we do not use your card to pay for it, which means you lose commission on a sale, and we have to use another card instead of the YYY one.

Furthermore that money was on there for my trip to Atlanta this Tuesday and now because of your unauthorized transaction on my account I don’t have my money for my trip. The supervisor refused to credit my money back. He would only credit $87.61 to bring me back to my $300 credit limit. He said it would be posted to my account by Tuesday. I don’t see a pending credit to my account and if I don’t see it credited on Tuesday I’m going to the media. Especially since your website says that the overpayment will remain as a credit on my account and be put towards any pending transactions and ONLY if my overpayment remains on my account for 6 months then you are legally obligated to try and issue me a refund. I have the screenshots for this article on your website as well. Furthermore I previously paid $415 in September into my credit card which is $115 over my credit limit instead of the most recent payment only going over by $50 and you guys didn’t issue me a refund then so why do it now when I did not request nor authorize it.

When I inquired about getting the limit increased, the person I spoke to said we would need to wait until our one year anniversary to have this reviewed. 
That sounds like a blanket rule to me, applied to everyone, regardless of how they manage their credit. We have not paid interest on a credit card for many few years. We pay off our balance two or more times each month. I’m not sure, given our history, how raising our limit would in any way put  ABC at risk.

1190,"Customer service has no clue how to answer questions about switching card options. Couldn't answer questions related to whether a new card would create two credit files on a credit report. Told me to contact the credit bureaus to find out whether  ABC would create two credit files for having two cards. And the biggest issue is the fact a card cannot be upgraded to a different card. If a customer wants to switch from a certain card to a different rewards option they should not have to open a new card and then cancel an alternative card. Options like this hurt customers credit as they would need to close longer credit files on their credit reports ultimately reducing the average length of a credit file and in turn negatively affecting it. For a company that is designed around helping customers rebuild credit, forcing them to stick with one card instead of allowing them to switch to a different card is just a way of ensuring they can ABCize on annual fees without providing any reward once a customer had ultimately improved their credit. Migrating a card or replacing a card with the same credit provider should not close an account, should allow the the same credit file just with a different card type.","Account Maintenance & Closing ,Becoming a Customer ,Credit/Debit Card ,Credit/Debit Card ,Credit/Debit Card ,Life Events ,Policy ,Representative ,Rewards ,Terms "

I wanted to take advantage of the various travel insurance benefits that come with the card but because I wasn’t “pre-approved” for an increase, I was told my limit had to remain at $10,000. As a result of not being able to charge the vacation to my card, I had to purchase separate travel insurance.

Since we live in Kanata and the address was listed as Orleans - 30 km away, I asked her to report the error. She said that if I was still getting my mail I shouldn't worry about it - because - there was nothing she could do to fix this error. I asked her if she was able to at least report the error. At the end of this call I assumed my card was activated so my partner called in to activate his and was told that mine was not yet activated. He was told that I had to call back again. I did and this time I encountered an intelligent life form who had no problem at all fixing the error in my address. At the end of this call I asked if my card was activated and she said no - she would have to put me back to the automated system. So there is a significant flaw in the automated card renewal system. The automated instructions ask if you want to activate your card (yes). Then they ask you to indicate whether your personal information is correct (no). Then you get transferred to someone with absolutely no indication that your card activation did not occur and the people on the phone evidently haven't been told to ensure that the card activation process is completed.","Credit/Debit Card ,Credit/Debit Card ,Issue Resolution ,Phone Experience ,Phone Experience ,Representative ,Transactions/Process Experience "

I also received conflicting information from your agents. One told me a year ago that my profile had been updated to reflect the fact that I travel to Italy often, and my card would not be blocked when making charges from Italy, while another agent told me last week that this was not true. 

I have other credit cards that go through easily while I am away from Canada. As a result of  ABC blocking my charge, I lost a flight to Canada since there was a time limit. I should be compensated for the loss.

I plan to cancel both my  ABC credit cards upon my return to Canada in December.

In my case my wife signed up for he account although I do all banking for the family.  I have no access at all, to the point that I can't even get a balance verbally from your staff even though I have my own card.  In many cases I cannot use the card for booking flights and was recommended to call your staff before booking flights.  Your card, and rules around it is very difficult and I therefore end up using my other MasterCard in most cases.  We're are an extremely busy family and don't have time to jump through hoops to try and make this process work.

Two of my colleagues were waiting in my office and overheard my last conversation with your staff and agreed that the use ability of your card is difficult and complicated in their view too.  I hope you figure it out and fix these problems.

I realized that I had paid the previous months amount and it was under paid by $6 . My point with the representative was that I made mistake, but a $36 interest charge was not appropriate for $6. HER ONLY RESPONSE WAS THAT I DIDNT PAY THE FULL AMOUNT..
The $68 dollar charge was because I was 2 days late in paying the amount. HER RESPONSE WAS...iT WAS LATE SIR.
I have three other cards that I use. You should look at the amount that I have used your card and calculate how much my dissatisfaction is going to cost you. I have other cards that allow a couple of days grace if it is not a regular occurrence.
It probably will not be worth my while to continue the card with a YYY membership as I do not spend enough at YYY to make it worth my while.

1630,"Both representatives carried arrogant attitudes during our conversations. They refused to listen to my concerns. The second representative even asked me to stop talking so that she can carry on her false explanations. The monthly statement does not state that payment need to be paid before the banking hours in eastern time in order for payment I made to stay on time. The second representative also used the previous two interest waivers as her “solid reason” to prove that the interest being charged this time was legitimate. She failed to consider the reasons behind those two interest waivers in the past were due to errors instead of favours to me. Frankly, I have three other credit cards but I don’t use them as much. YYY MasterCard is currently the primary credit card I use because I like it and I care. Switching a card campany to me is as simple as one decision. I have no problem of paying that $39 interest and I will. The thing that don’t like is the way that I was being treated. I hope no other people will need to go through the same bad experience that happened on me yesterday. Good luck to your company’s future success.

This is ridiculous as there is no way I would be calling to get the name changed on my card if it was right to begin with.

I spent 45 minutes on the phone initially trying to get my credit limit increased only to be told we cannot up your limit.......you have great credit, you pay your account on time, but you don’t charge enough money to your account.

In the end I had to use another bank's credit card to make the ticket purchase.

I would have thought that the question would have related specifically to the level and type of service I received. I would recommend interacting with  ABC on the basis of the very courteous, consultative and professional service I received from the specific female representative when I called in to discuss a matter regarding a charge. The attributes and value of your credit card in relation to your service bears no relationship or direct comparison. As for the card itself, would I recommend it on its own rather than its tie-in to YYY? Probably. But in competition with other similar credit cards, the  ABC Mastercard does not offer significant differentiation or value to make it a highly distinguishable credit card. There is nothing unique about it other than its association with YYY. Am I satisfied with the  ABC MC? I am but not exhilaratingly so.","Brand ,Brand ,Representative ,Representative ,Representative ,Representative "

He also told me that it should not be a problem as long as i paid on or before the 6th.  However, he did not explain what i would need to do if i got a charge, or if he would be putting a note in the file of our conversation.  Also, another credit card company told me the same thing, and I had been their customer for over 8 years, and suddenly one day i got charged even though i paid the day before due, and they told me a different story.

Upon realizing my mistake, I contacted  ABC.  I was given two options: either request  ABC to send the money to me by cheque, or have my bank (CIBC) issue a fax to  ABC to reverse the charge.  I was told either route was going to take about six weeks to process, which is totally unacceptable!  That is a ton of money to be out for a month and a half and makes it almost impossible to pay all my bills in the interim.  Why  ABC does not offer balance transfers on their credit cards I don't know, as I would have been able to clear up the entire matter within minutes, rather than in six weeks time.  For that reason alone, I'm now leery about recommending your card to others.","Brand ,Brand ,Issue Resolution ,Payments ,Representative ,Transaction Types ,Transaction Types ,Transactions/Process Experience "

2447,"First of all, the woman I spoke with was terrific.  The fault is that you don't allow prepaying in excess of the credit limit -- for instance, me and my two kids travel a lot -- ideally, we would preload say $ 5,000 onto my ABC MC, and spend 2-4 weeks traveling, using the credit card instead of what? Amex traveler checks?  Bank debit machines? Cash?  I know -- my Visa card, which lets us do that.

I was shocked when I prepaid about $ 1,000 on my ABC MC, and soon after got a cheque in the mail from you for almost $ 900.  I wanted the $s available in excess of my credit limit -- good thing I wasn't arguing with a hotel or airline clerk in Latvia or some such place, eh?

So now I know that, basically, except for YYY and the like, your credit card has limited utility for my family, certainly it's unreliable and pretty much useless for our extended travel plans.  But then, as they say, for everything else, there's Visa (and American Express).","Brand ,Policy ,Representative ,Terms "

I was told that it could only be replaced at the expiratory date on the card, which is Feb 2019, and this is of no benefit to me.  I have travelled using other credit cards and when my stay outside the country was for an extended length of time, I was able to get a new card with an expiry date that covered my time away.  I do not understand the issue with changing the card to cover someone who is travelling and your service desk stated that I could look into having my mail forwarded to my temporary address.  This does not work and I would have liked to been issued a new card providing me with an expiry date that covered me while outside the country.

I also got two notices of non payment of bills.  When you use a credit card exclusively it is difficult to be almost half a month without it.  I complained to YYY Customer Service and I was told to get another credit card or two.  So, now after two years of using a YYY Mastercard exclusively, I am back to asking friends and searching for  better credit card.  Obviously Mastercard was not able to get a replacement card to me within a week and this is a big issue.  So, I will not recommend the card to others who might find themselves in my situation.  The most important service a credit card company can have is to get a replacement card back to a customer.

When the 1st 10 days and no money I phoned and then they told me 30 days...when that 30 days was up I phoned again and it was another 30 days.  I finally was able to speak to a supervisor this week after very strongly insisting to do so. The supervisor then informed me that they had held on to my money because they said it was a money laundering scheme... but why all of these months when I had provided proof months ago of what had happened. He informed me that I should be getting it latest by this Friday but if I did not receive it I was to call and they would cancel the cheque and start the rigamorole all over again.
But who can I turn to as they have my money and I do not?

2858,"The main reason is that I have been charged a seventy dollar fee to have the card.  It is a 300 dollar limit.  I had never gone over limit and I KNOW for a fact that I would not have accepted the card at all if there were any annual fee, and that there was not one, let alone one that ridiculous.  I went to use the card and it was declined.  When I saw my bill I called to ask about the fee.  I was told that it was certain I had been charged before.  I asked for my records to be checked and for someone with any authority regarding this to get back in touch with me.  Not only has there been no response *except for this* your company had the gaul to charge me a $30 over limit fee, when you are the ones who put me over the limit.  I am still up to date and I am seriously considering my options.  Right now, on a card that has never been overdue, almost one third of the total is from the fee plus your overlimit charge.  I am on welfare and right now, and there is NOTHING you can do to damage my credit, and quite a bit that I can probably do with legal aide to investigate you and your actions in this. Without any action from you I will seek legal action through legal aide.  I qualify immediately due to welfare and they are alway interested in anything either luring low income people in or trying to function in a grey, if not a fraudulent manner.  I am certain that I was told this was a no fee card and would not have applied for it were it not.  Remove the fee, and remove the overlimit charge now please..

Call taker and underwriting dept. we're good and understanding of my issue. However, they advised it was out of there control and it was   ABC policy that was preventing for me from obtaining a higher limit even though I pay off the credit in full every month.  They admitted that I have a very good history with  ABC Credit Card.  Other credit cards I use have substantial higher limits and keep offering higher limits. I like the cash back idea. However, due to me and my wife consistingly being embarrassed when the cards are declined due to going over limit.  I have told my wif that we will only use  ABC card for the first 20 days of the month and then use the other credit card after that. Unfortunately, this means that  ABC will miss out on retail charges.
Hopefully  ABC will change its policy in the near future so we can go back to using the credit card for all the days each month.

3019,"I am upset with an error which you made,  that has now caused my account to be in bad standing.  Last month, there was an $1800 credit added to my account. I thought it was either a corrected mistake from the past, or monies from when my card started out as a secured card.  Regardless of the reason, who doesn't welcome a credit to their account?


Well, not shortly after, I received an email (2 to 3 weeks later) from you saying that the credit was an error, and it would be deducted from my account.  This has caused my account to go seriously over the limit. Were it not for this mistake, made by  ABC, my account would not be in this condition.


While I accept that I cannot keep a credit that you deem to be an error, I would expect some help from  ABC in dealing with the current status of my account. For example, if you were to raise my credit limit just enough to cover the amount it is over, so I do not have to deal with over the limit fees, or over the limit status, even if for just a short term until I can get my account back down - this would help out quite a bit.


I cannot stress enough that your error caused my account to be so badly over the limit.

When i called i got zero help and although your offer of 30.00 credit is nice 30.00 neans nothing to me when you screwed me up this bad and my account so badly over. i have pre-authorized items that now will bounce abd some that HAVE

It used to be the 8th or 9th of the month.  It is now usually the 3rd of the month.  While making full payment is not an issue with us doing it after we receive our pensions cheques makes the timeline is stressful plus an irritating factor.  
I have been told that 
1) All Canada YYY members now have the same cut off and payment dates.  NOT true as other YYY members have different payment dates.
And
2) Our cut off and payment dates are selected by Postal Codes.

He started asking me validation questions, which I kept giving him until he said that he will also require to send an email and I validate the code. It was upsetting to me that I gave close to 5 validations including the PIN that I had already entered into the system. I requested that these are enough validations, upon which he said that he will not be able to continue with me and I hung up. Later I realised that he had blocked my card as my online purchase of 'Chikadee' magazine for my young daughter was not going through! I called and again and was directed to fraud. I validated everything with the lady and she laughingly said that probably 'Chikadee' doesn't take MasterCard, which I later found out they do. She asked me to use VISA and check, and my transaction went through with VISA. She then assured me that the card is fine and there is not problem with it. 
Next day I went to YYY on Sep 10th and it was declined. It was immensely embarrassing for me that the card got declined because I use my YYY  ABC Master card for basically everything. Now I had to pay with my debit card (I lost my points that I could have accumulated).
I come back home and call  ABC and again directed to fraud. I verified all information and she put me on hold, then she laughed and said 'You sound like a very polite man and not rude at all' so I will release the block on your card. I was really turned off by this.
Later, I realised that my car insurance that comes out on 11th of every month did NOT go through. Insurance company contacted me and waved my NSF charges because it happened the FIRST time in the last 19 years. I had to pay them on Sep 20.

This past week I got a fraud alert call, after a $600 online purchase was made. When I called back, I was told that $6000 of fraudulent purchases had been made on the card, all of them online, and all of them internationally. Not only did I not make any of these purchases, none of them corresponded remotely to the pattern of use already established on the card, even taking into account I'd only had the card for 8 weeks or so. I only got the card because it was recommended to me at an HBC retail counter, in order to get a discount. I should have been called earlier, and the first online or international purchase should have produced a fraud alert. Now I have to wait for the outcome of the fraud investigation, worrying about the whole thing. I would not recommend either a  ABC, or HBC credit product going forward, and would warn people against these products.","Account Communications ,Brand ,Fraud Alerts ,Fraud Alerts ,Fraud and Disputes ,Fraud and Disputes ,Phone Experience ,Promotions and Benefits "

We received no assistance, so requested Evensi reimburse the money.  According to them --- they were not will to do so... hence us approaching  ABC to reverse the charges as we did not receive the service.

When we called  ABC to issue the complaint, we felt that the representative taking down our information lacked communication and/or listening skills. She kept trying to steer the details to suit her ""idea"" of what the situation actually entailed, and she asked questions that were literally impossible to answer as they did not reflect the issue. It was very frustrating, confusing and daunting. Granted, this situation may not have been familiar to her --- however we feel that the information she took down will not represent our dispute correctly.  

We are waiting for the actual package in the mail so that we can dispute the issue in our own words using our actual evidence.

3336,"I am a huge advocate for HBC for reasons that are both based on a loyalty to a Canadian retailer (knowing that ownership is not) and a long time career in retail. My qualification on advocating is based on my recent experience where clearly my credit card has been compromised and I am not fully satisfied that the credit services are protecting my best interests. While the people I spoke with were polite and well intentioned I would point out the following concerns -
1. I waited on hold for at least 30 minutes from the time I spoke with a customer service agent until someone in the fraud division took the call. 
2. I was told to pay my minimum payment to protect my credit record, even though the fraud agent acknowledged that they were aware of other reports of the same or similar fraud on accounts. This creates unease for me as paying the minimum payment may suggest I have responsibility for the charge. I did make the payment but other than this survey email I have received no assurances from your company that I am not responsible and that fraud is being investigated. 
3. I was told that it may take two billing cycles to clear this matter from my credit. This was explained as needing the time to clear up the matter with the company making the charges. If it is known as fraud why am I being kept involved? 
4. I was told that my current account would be canceled by the fraud department person that I spoke with last evening. As of 24 hours later I have received no confirmation from your company that the account has been cancelled. This makes me feel very vulnerable. 
5. While the two people I spoke with were polite and clearly trying to provide some reasonable level of customer service, I suspect that your policies get in the way of them doing a true quality job on customer service. 

Hopefully you will find this feedback useful - I am the Dean of a business school and the former Chair of the Retail Management Bachelor of Commerce degree at a Canadian University.

This is a very odd way to handle fraud charges I would have expected it to be actioned right away and with a sense of concern or urgency but instead I was the one that suggested to freeze my account number. Then I was told to call back after I see my transactions posted. When I logged in the next day, I wasn’t allowed access to my account, which was frustrating because o was told to check my account for transactions to be posted. It’s like this reporting process didn’t think about the customer experience. So I called back 5 days later and after spending time giving all my personal information I was told one of the transactions didn’t post yet and to call back later. This was obsurd. After complaining about how inconvenient this process is, I advised not only is this taking up my time, that I am without a credit card and one won’t be issued until after my case is sent to the fraud Dept which is supposed to be after I call back when my transactions post. Somehow after advising that I am without a card, the agent put me on hold and came back to say he will forward my case on to the fraud dept and issue my new card. So now somehow this was handled before one of the transactions posting. I am still going through this process as I have to wait for a form and my card in the mail in the next 7-10 business days. But this process doesn’t have me feeling confident about the next time I see fraud charges appear on my card that the agents know what they’re doing or thinking about the customer experience.","Credit/Debit Card ,Credit/Debit Card ,Fraud and Disputes ,Fraud and Disputes ,Issue Resolution ,Phone Experience ,Phone Experience ,Representative ,Representative ,Transactions/Process Experience ,Transactions/Process Experience "

Why would you even send a mail saying that... that's stupid. I hope that didn't hurt my credit. and $500 is a joke.

So I increased my credit card from another credit card company to increase mine from $3000 to $6200.

The order would not go thru as there was some kind of HBC MC issue.  I called HBC MC and the agent said my card was blocked. I asked why and she said she that the notes said there was NO address on file. I told that does not make sense as we have the cards that were mailed to our address in June/2017 and I activated them on 6/14/2017. She tried to unblock it a few times and I could not get the order thru. She then passed us on to the security dept and that individual said there was some type of system access error and she could not unblock me and that I had to call back later. I told her that I was trying to order 7 items from HBC. I asked her to call me back when it was unblocked, she said she very busy with other customers, dismissed me and then just hung up. Never did get a call back. This issue with HBC MC lasted almost 1 hour and 45 min and NOT resolved and in the interim 1 of the 7 items sold out.> NOT happy.  At that point I gave up with HBC MC and used our Visa card and it went thru as a non-event. I ended up not only missing 1 item, but had to pay for shipping and NO HBC points
I called back HBC MC on Wed 8/8 and talked another 30+ minutes to see if the card was unblocked and same issue. We were told that WE put the block on the account on Jan 4/18 .. which did not happen as we were in Florida at the time .. Finally resolved.. very disturbing ..

I made a smaller payment and about a week later went out to the bar bringing only my credit card to pay my bill.  When I went to pay what I owed the card declined.  I called in to the call center and the woman I spoke to there was apologetic but said I would have to call in the next day to get my account unfrozen.

4039,"I’ve had consistently terrible customer service with  ABC. Most recently I requested a second card be sent out for an authorized user on my account. When it hadn’t arrived after 4+ weeks I called to inquire. This is when the problem started as I was told the card was mailed a month earlier to ‘my Canadian address’ even though I live in Denver, CO & that it’s impossible to mail a card to a US address. There’s 3 huge problems with this:
1) IF this is true, I should have been informed the first time I called & ordered the card
2) It’s simply not true, since my card was compromised a couple months ago & a new card was sent to me in Denver
3) I don’t HAVE a Canadian address! I live in Denver & this should be the only address associated with my account. I receive all my correspondence from you at this address & have for a very long time. So the fact that you’re sending my card & personal information to some random Canadian address is VERY upsetting!

After going through this conversation for about 30 minutes I asked to speak with a manager. I was put on hold for 10 minutes & then told the office was closed & I should call back the next day.

Like I said, this is just the most recent incident that has made me despise you’re company. Literally THE ONLY reason I didn’t cancel my account on the spot was that I have just been charged my yearly fee.

4157,"I had a death in my family and called when I realised that my payment was going to be a couple of days late. The person told me to pay the full bill (One of my highest monthly bills ever) and that when the interest was posted to the account I should phone back and it would be removed at that time. I was very relieved.  When I called back they would only take of $30 per month.  You can see by my payment history that I pay each bill off in full each month.  I assume you can see my call history. So, to be told by one agent, very emphatically, that the interest would be reversed to call and have another one say that they would take off $30 was frustrating. I lost a lot of faith in this company that day and it leaves a sour taste. I am actively looking for a replacement card.","Brand ,Credit/Debit Card ,Payments ,Phone Experience ,Terms "

Your system is not able to change our statement date by 5 days - from the 6th to the 11th of the month.  This should be a very simple process!!!  Please find someone who has the knowledge  to make this very simple change.  We would still be paying our bill within the 3 weeks!!!

I have spoken to a manager twice in regards to this matter.  So far, they have told me that your system cannot make this change and they are working on it!!!

In fact, my monthly charges are normally in the $2,000 to $2,500 range and occasionally more..  I pay every statement each month in full, usually days before the due date, but never late.
So, you can understand why I was surprized and upset for your decision in this matter as I was only looking for a $2,000 to $3,000 increase in my credit limit in anticipation of some upcoming vacation expenses.
As a result, I will use another credit card for these expenses.

4420,"I called  ABC to see if it would be possible to reduce the interest rate on my card - I had done so with The Bank of Montreal two days before and they were very accomodating. When I called  ABC It was explained to me that it would not be possible to negotiate the interest rate, okay, fair enough. When I questioned why, it was explained to me that it was due to my spending habits. And that because I only pay the minimum balance, which is not true. And even so, it doesn't matter because as long as i pay it on time. I have paid off the card before and recently paid most of it off back around February. There are times when i pay only the minimum, but most of the time I pay more than the minimum. 

I wasn't impressed with the service, i felt like five year old being punished. I'm not saying it's the fault of the person I spoke with, she probably was just doing her job and following protocol, but nonetheless it was annoying. Your punishing me with interest for carrying a balance of which you make money off of. 

I work in customer service myself, and I think a better option would have been to offer a solution to your customers. Not, well you have spending habits so we will charge you high interest until you learn you lesson. And for instance, if it had to do with the type of card i had perhaps it would be more beneficial say to the customer "" I'm sorry we're unable to do that, because it's the type of card you have. But I can recommend that the best option would be to pay off the card and once you have contact us again and we'd be happy to switch you to one that offers a better interest rate."" Something like that. I will most likely be getting rid of it in a few months once it's paid off.

I called to inquire about raising my credit limit from $6000 to $8000 as we are doing renovations to our house and I wanted to bill most of them on my card in order to utilize the cash back program. My current bill was up to date and I had just paid an ad'l $5000 so that I would have a substantial credit on my account to cover the first reno bill of $5080. I was somewhat surprised that I didn't qualify for the additional credit supposedly because I usually only charge $2000 a month (which has always been paid off each month). According to one of your service reps if I spent $5000 - $6000 on a regular basis I would have likely been offered a limit increase!! I have excellent credit and always pay my bills on time so I really couldn't make sense of this. Consequently, I had the $5000 payment reversed by my bank and decided to use their credit card instead. They also had no problem increasing my credit limit!!

4603,"security flags were incorrectly identified and service denied -for no reason. When I was asked clarification questions, I gave appropriate answers -just not the answers that the staff had before them. I am not required to tell the credit card company that my department has been re-named 3times, I work for the government of Canada, my ultimate employer -no matter what department for whom I work. The policy that the staff operates under does not permit there to be departmental name changes (of which I have had 3, so when asked to name my employer, it was deemed incorrect). It is frustrating and ultimately ineffective to try to amange my employer in such a regretted way. 

Second issue was that when I was told I need to answer the next question correctly and the freeze would be lifted, I answered 4 questions all correctly. Incorr ct direction. In the end, I did not have any fraudulent activity on my card - just things that were purchased from places call Lexington (so not in the city, but a restaurant).

I asked that they call me back and I was told to call back. I travel a fair bit for work and it is not convenient to go through the process while I have 26 people awaiting instructions. I can, however, take a call. 

What your company lost is that I was on a business trip that week, where I expensed $3000 on another credit card.

I am debating whether I want this credit card anymore due to the inept service and rude interactions I had on 2 occasions with your staff.  It only seems to encourage the lack of service I got.

It was clearly my error that I read my statement wrong at the time I made my online payment getting the second number wrong and leaving a $10.00 outstanding balance. My intention was to pay the July bill in full. If you checked my account I have always paid my bill in full and on time!
So to my astonishment to see a $9.85 interest charge on a $10.00 balance I was stunned to say the least.

After a year I could not get an increase because I had not been at the limit often enough. I make large purchases a few times a year and need the extra limit for these purchases. The last time I had to put into smaller orders and send money to pay it down imediatlyso the rest of the order could go through. I sent an order in last week that I charges to my credit card. I will be a little over $24,000. My credit limit is $18000 so I sent a payment that day ( Thursday,24 August) to bring my balance to zero and phoned to suggest I would send another payment of $6500 to cover the difference so I would not be over the limit. I was told that it would not be authorized as it was over the $18,000 limit even though there would be a credit in my account so it would actually NOT be over the limit. The payment will probably come out this week so I have not arrived at a solution yet. I asked them about doing a one time flag on my account to let it through if the money was there and I would NOT be over the limit. Apparently that is not possible.   IT appears the computer system is running the people and not the people running the computer system.  Since I can't use your card for the large purchases I will have to use another Credit card or a wire transfer for payment. Once again not using my  ABC card to near the limit because the limit is not high enough and apparently I can't get a higher limit because I don't use it near the limit enough.

This made no sense to me & I told this to the agent, he advised it was just the way the system worked.  I continued to question this as it didn't even make sense & was against accounting principles.  He advised it was in the small print in the contract, at this point I asked to speak to someone at a higher level.  He advised they would tell me the same thing but I insisted.

Given the issues that Canadians who are in the cannabis sector (even if only as an investor in Canadian stocks), in crossing into the US, I find it unreasonable that YYY would require the industry in which I work as part of renewing my M/C.

So we lost the opportunity to buy good plane tickets for a family of six persons because the transaction was block, we had to buy tickets that were not only more expensive but also at a very inconvenient time. Last winter, you block a transaction to buy tickets for a music festival in Europe (the tickets are sold in just 1 hour) so we had to pay 2400$ for tickets instead of 1200$... There are also countless other times that transactions were block such as at my supermarket where I buy groceries every week, to buy local bus tickets, train tickets in Europe from Canada, at a national park in Israel (we called to warn that we were going to travel there and it was block anyways) and so on... 
Another issue is that it is always the main owner of the card that has to call to unblock the card and my spouse cannot do it, it is very annoying.

I was calling requesting that they remove the authorisations so that I could redo the cancelled order but they told me it was not possible and to have YYY call them.  This is a YYY MasterCard...You should have the ability to validate the cancellation without putting the customer out further. Either that or make a reasonability decision and see that I am not someone who buys 3 computers in a day so the story is reasonable enough to remove one of the authorisations.

If reapplying is necessary, that's ok, but I feel like there could be a better process for this. Even if it was essentially reapplying and canceling the other card, but I was guided through that process instead of just copy-pasted the same text about applying online. 

I did end up applying and got rejected for the card. I'm not sure why, but I did see one of the requirements was a 3-year credit history, and I am coming up on my third anniversary date for my card with the yearly fee, so that is why I wanted to talk to someone instead of doing it online, in case that was the requirement I was missing, it could possibly be pushed through/timed so I didn't have to pay the yearly fee again.","Account Communications ,Account Maintenance & Closing ,Becoming a Customer ,Becoming a Customer ,Credit/Debit Card ,Credit/Debit Card ,Credit/Debit Card ,Policy ,Terms "

It did not work again, so I called  ABC to find out why the purchase would not go through.  I was informed that it was for our protection as someone else could have been trying to make this purchase with our card.  The fellow I talked to was able to put the purchase through, however, he said the card was now going to have to be cancelled as it was flagged as a risk.  He was going to issue a new card right away, but it will take 7 - 10 days to get to us.

Although I appreciate the fact that ABC is looking out for us, this has been a REAL inconvenience as we have this card attached to a few things and now have to go through the process of changing the number with all these companies!

I'm not sure as to how this could have been better handled on your part...maybe a phone call to us, to ask us if this was a purchase we were making, BEFORE you cancelled the card.  That being said, I'm still a little confused as to why the card needed to be cancelled in the first place.  I called you immediately after the transactions would not go through and it was confirmed that we were who we said we are, and that we were the people trying to make the purchase......yet, it was still cancelled!  As I explained at the beginning of this note, the man I spoke with WAS able to use that number to make the purchase that we were trying to do online, but then the card had to be cancelled anyway......I think it was clear, at that point, that it wasn't being fraudulently used and that it was NOT a risk!","Account Maintenance & Closing ,Credit/Debit Card ,Credit/Debit Card ,Phone Experience ,Phone Experience ,Representative ,Transactions/Process Experience "

Since owning this card, I have twice tried to increase the credit limit by several thousand dollars, in order to make it more usable.  I continually have to monitor my monthly expenditures to confirm I will not exceed the limit, which I have on occasion.  The personnel I spoke to are recently, while not outright rude, are bordering on this in their defense of the credit limit size.  I am not allowed to escalate the conversation to anyone who will give me a reason for preventing an increase in credit limit.  Indeed, this latest attempt, I was told to subject myself to a thorough credit rating check, only for an additional thousand dollars.  I have other cards that will easily provide the credit I need, and will be using them more in the future.  I cannot recommend a card I find so restrictive to anyone else.","Customer Service ,Policy ,Representative ,Terms "

Have always paid my account on time and most of the time I pay in advance of getting my statement.

5780,"I was looking to rebuild my credit. ABC offered a master card with a low limit of 300 to assist. It was explained that after 12 months, if I had no late payments or missed payments that I would be eligible for another card with a higher credit limit.

I called in after 12 months and was told that I was not eligible because the card went over limit a few times. This was upsetting because I was told to use the card as much as possible and pay on time, but due to the amount of time it takes payments to post I am now in this situation.

I did everything I was told. I felt that ABC could of helped me by declining anythibg that went over limit enabling me to be qualified. I had to demand that the card be declined at the arranged limit going forward.

It was a very uncomfortable call. Very upset.

 However my discontent with this financial institution is based on the fact I can not reset my forgotten pin. 
I am in a situation where I am counting on using my card to purchase necessities. 
I have to wait for snail mail to deliver within 10 business days. 
This I find more then aggravating as I don’t need a pin to make online purchases however when in a store at the POS I can only hope that specific location has a tap option that my purchase won’t exceed.

The issue is that my pension cheques do not arrive until the end of the month. My bill payment is the 2 of the following month. I cannot pay the bill on line in time as you require 5 business days for money to transfer which would make my payment late. I therefor am burdened to either use savings or LOC to pay the bill well before the end of the previous month in order to not  incur late charges from you. Not happy about that at all.

6039,"I have cancelled my card with this company pending unsatisfactory resolution of a fraud perpetrated on me in June and July by a company calling themselves "" Betamuscles"". I was billed for their product over $ 450.00 which was never ordered by me. There are numerous Canadians who have been swindled by this company. 
At any rate the manner in which the fraud department at  ABC handled this whole procedure was terrible and unprofessional. At no time was I ever allowed to even speak with a supervisor, even after repeated requests to do so. This is contrary to their own rules regarding disputes. They had only a small percentage of their staff who even speak legible English, and it wasn't until repeated phone calls on the third day of seeking resolution that I managed to even speak with someone who spoke clear easy to understand English. 
The amount of time I spent on hold, as well as being cut off twice over the three days I sought resolution was most perplexing. 
I have only had to report a fraud once before, to the Visa fraud department, who were professional in every sense of the word and resolved my complaint satisfactorily on the first call. 
Dealing with  ABC was a nightmare and I have terminated my account with them and will never do business with them again. I feel that YYY should find a company who is superior in every way.

Even though arrangements have been made, I have continued to receive calls with the understanding no notes show on my file of having already had the conversations with your representatives so have to go through it all over again.  Most recent call, I was frustrated and probably quite rude to the poor girl calling, but was just a bad day.  I know what I have to do, but it seems one hand doesn't talk to the other at  your center.  The representatives are not putting their notes in showing my conversations so I am hoping this last one was entered.  My apologies, I don't typically get so upset but it had been a stressful day.

6484,"August 10, 2018

To Whom It May Concern:

In response to your email, I am very disappointed with the service I have received.  First of all, I am authorized on Mr. Goldenberg’s  ABC card.  When I wanted to talk to someone about an interest charge, they refused to talk to me.  We pay all our bills on time.  They said that they could only talk to Mr. Goldenberg personally.  When I mentioned that he was not well, they still insisted and Mr. Goldenberg called  ABC from home.  He was told that the interest charge would be removed on the next bill.

At that point in order that we would not get another interest charge, I made a special trip to YYY to pay the account.  After waiting in line, I was told that I could not pay at YYY.   I had to pay it at the bank or on line.

So on July 27, 2018, I went to HSBC bank and paid the bill.  On August 6, I received an email telling me that our payment was due on August 8.  After talking to Valerie at your Customer Service, I went back to HSBC bank to confirm that we had paid Allan Goldenberg’s  ABC YYY Card on July 27.  The bank gave me a copy of my bank account, which indicated payment on July 27.  I faxed this to 855-610-0645, together with a copy of my cheque and the statement copy.  On the fax I asked:  “Please confirm receipt of this fax.”

On August 8, since I had not received confirmation of my fax, I called your customer service and spoke with Ernest.  Ernest could not confirm that the fax was sent, nor could he confirm that payment had been made.  He told me that it takes up to 2 or 3 weeks to be resolved.
So, although I do not want to pay on line, I went back to HSBC and set up an online payment account.  It took about ¾ of an hour and has a couple of passwords.  I am not happy with this.  And, I am certainly not happy with the fact that my payment cannot be verified.
Due to this unsatisfactory and disappointing experience, I cannot recommend  ABC.

Yours truly,

So I ask for a $2000 increase to my limit and the guy says I am not allowed to because I don't spend enough.  Almost thought I was talking to a government department due to the stupidity and absurdity of that statement.  
I request a higher limit to use my card more and get refused, and he says that's all he can do. That's the end of it.
The only reason I am not dumping this card today is because it benefits me with my YYY membership.
I was at a vendor years ago making a large purchase and I was up against my limit because of that. I called the PC Financial service line and in less than 30 minutes I had my increase,  paid for my item and was on my way.
Clearly someone at this company knows who I am because of the survey request,  so get in contact with me if that's possible through this survey.
Married family man over 50 with no credit card debt , home owner ,and full time job, refused a measly $2000 credit limit increase.

Your customer service staff have repeatedly hung up on me while answer the phone. I do not think that they appreciate the amount of time it takes to go through your extensive prompts prior to them picking up the phone. Doing it twice each time I need to call through deters me from wanting to ever call through. The frustration starts before I even start dialing! 

The people answering your phone are extremely unpleasant. They hate their lives. They hate themselves. They could not care less if I have a good experience or not. They are unapologetic about it. They are unaccommodating. 

The fraud department flags the most random things. I could not even buy my airline tickets using this card. That's fine, however, I will just spend my money using a more convenient card. 

The problem of the auto-pay is just mind blowing. It never actually pays my entire sum. I always have to manually pay the remaining balance so that I have my total reset. 

For all my previous credit cards, I pay manually without issues. For this card, if there is a transaction made between payment and the bill cycle date, it will charge me interest. NEVER seen that before. So they tell me that the autopay will fix this problem, except it is inconvenient due to the issue above!

They had taken awhile to get here and we immediately started to activate them - they took quite awhile to activate - whether we were not used to your system or what but in a phone call with  ABC we were assured that all was well - lots of information went back and forth.  After that conversation I felt better and then we got another set of cards and now I was worried - silly maybe, but I wondered if I had spoken to  ABC or someone else and was worried I had made a mistake of not being as cautious as usual in conversation ... so I called  ABC and talked to someone who told me to destroy the new cards and carry on with the ones I had activated.  I told her that I was upset because of the 2nd cards making me worried that the first were not real!  And, so that is my story.  I destroyed the new cards and we have kept the ones first received, although we have yet to use them.  We have just mailed a cheque to  ABC to pay the balance.","Credit/Debit Card ,Payments "

6973,"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.
Your people didn't check my/my husbands' identity via phone like they said they'll do, so the bottom line is that we were unable to use our funds for 2 and 1/2 weeks. During that time, I/we phoned  ABC THREE times and every time I was told the account would be blocked for 24-48 , then 72  and then again 72 hours. 
Great situation, especially when you move into a new house the next day and my husband had to go overseas for more than 2 weeks. 

When my husband got back from his business trip, we drove to the physical address in North York, Toronto. We had our passports and drivers licenses to identify ourselves, just to learn that  ABC move to Bay Street in Toronto, and never updated the information on their web site. As my husband had to take time off work, we didn't have enough time to drive the the new address.

I visited YYY as a last resource for help, as the next step would have been to go to the local police station ( as indicated by one of the  ABC employees). After more than 30 minutes on the telephone with  ABC (who still refused to activated our account, although I was standing right in front of the YYY employee who could identify me, as my photo is on the  ABC credit card),  it was still not good enough the activate my card. With the persistent help of the YYY employee's help, our account was activated.

After all the stress and anxiety this two and a half week episode caused us, we closed the account the same day. I would never recommend  ABC to anyone.","Account Maintenance & Closing ,Account Maintenance & Closing ,Becoming a Customer ,Brand ,Credit/Debit Card ,Credit/Debit Card ,Customer Service ,Life Events ,Phone Experience ,Representative ,Representative "

And I have concerns that need to be addressed ie: I have not received any bills in the mail for 9 MONTHS now.  I have been able to get around this by signing in online to check my bill, but I still should continue to receive my bill in the mail.  I have never signed up for paperless billing.  Finally, some system at  ABC flagged that my mailing address was marked undeliverable.  So I logged in online to double check my mailing address and it is FINE, and the EXACT same address that I have been using for 20 years for everybody else, yet for whatever reason  ABC screws up yet again, and I am sick and tired of wasting about a total of 5 hours over the past year waiting on the phone to speak to the non-existent customer service at  ABC.  Back in December when  ABC accidentally stopped sending me paper statements, I missed a bill payment because of it, which is  ABC's fault, which you still have not fixed to this day in terms of sending me any paper statements.","Account Communications ,Account Communications ,Issue Resolution ,Issue Resolution ,Phone Experience ,Phone Experience ,Website Security "

I have a relatively low limit & when I requested a credit increase was flatly refused. I pay fairly high interest rates on this card which you're only too happy to take, I have never requested a rate decrease & yet apparently I'm a credit risk not worthy of a small increase.

I have only one credit card with Scotiabank, while I was a student they gave me 2500 and once I got into work permit they again increased to 4500. I haven’t missed any payments and maintain a good credit history. Considering all this and seeking your add in social media and email promotions I trusted you guys and expected from  ABC the same as the other bank did it’s kind of giving me high amount depression and breach of trust towards the  ABC adds and fake promises. I will never ever trust  ABC and I will make sure my friends doesn’t get into these fake traps of the financial companies and i would really find a way to get an explaination regarding to this content.

I made an emergency bank payment to my credit card to reduce the amount and called to inquire if I could increase my credit limit by only $250 so that I would be able to cover my hotel expenses for the last night I would be staying in the UK. The person I spoke to choose not to help me and would not increase my limit until my bank payment had cleared in 2 to 3 days. This left me in dire straits with no option to pay for my hotel. I have been a long standing customer with ABC who ALWAYS pays my full balance EVERY month. I was in real trouble and you would not help me. I have since applied for a new credit card with another company and will be receiving it in 5 days. Once received I will transfer my balance and will be cancelling my card with you. I hope that the potential risk I would have caused for a mere $250 will be worth loosing a long time customer in excellent standing. Check your records, I'm sure they will match my claim. Please do not bother to contact me about this incident. There is nothing more to be said. I will NEVER choose ABC again.

Well at the end of the month, I checked my bank account and the original amount due on my statement was still withdrawn from my bank account!  I ended up paying twice the amount due.  I still owed money on my account as I continued to make credit card purchases so next month my bill will be lower.

When I have prepaid some money on my other credit card accounts after I received my statement but before the due date, the amount prepaid was deducted from the total amount withdrawn that month by the credit card company authorized on my bank account.

It has literally been longer than two months and the problem still has not been fixed. Your company keeps asking me to confirm my phone number and my email address with your organization. I have now done this twice with two different employees and still I keep being prevented from accessing my account online. There is no reason why your company should be asking me to confirm my home phone number or my email address with your organization because this information has not changed. When I try to respond to this aggressive system message it will not allow me (your system), to acknowledge the information you (as a company) are unnecessarily asking me for is correct. Without being allowed, deliberately, to confirm the information you have on file for me is correct I am not being allowed to go into my online account. Now your company deliberately without checking with me stopped sending my account information to my email account so I can't even get my payment amount or my due date without calling your organization. When I tried to call your company to get this important information so I could make a payment that your company was deliberately for no reason preventing me from making, your telephone system did not work. This type of extremely serious incompetence is totally 100% unacceptable! I am am appalled at the disgraceful behaviour of your staff, all the more so because the failure to do their jobs properly was done so deliberately. Each phone call to your company, to try to sort out a problem staff at your organization deliberately caused for no valid reason, has resulted in the failure of your staff to solve the problem. I have just received a pointless phone call from one of your employees, who has deliberately once again, not solved the problem. Take off this system's message immediately and don't ever do something like this to my account again! You, as a company, are making it deliberately difficult for me to pay my bill. You as a organization are deliberately, for no reason, preventing me from accessing my account online. Solve the problem now! Stop playing games! Stop being so seriously unprofessional! The issue has been repeatedly, in a very clear fashion explained to you. What exactly is your problem anyway? Why are you deliberately not doing your jobs properly? This is deliberate, calculated, incompetence. Nothing about what has happened her is accidental. My clear expectation of you (as an organization) is you fix this problem now! No, I possess no desire to talk, and talk, and talk, and explain, and explain, and explain what the problem is while you (as a company) do nothing effective  to solve the problem. How many more times am I going to have to contact your organization while your staff while fully understanding the seriousness of the problem do absolutely nothing to fix the problem? I repeat: how many more phone calls am I going to have to make before you do what you should have done when I called the first time, or when you were fully aware you had caused a serious problem; therefore, should have fixed the problem?
